# line 1 ... I saw the following numbers 11, 18, 5, 20 and 15 after running line 1 five times
# the smallest number it could have and I did see was 5, the largest was 20

# line 2 ... I saw the following numbers 3, 9, 3, 7 and 9 after running line 2 five times
# the smallest number I could have seen would be 3 and the largest would be 9
# I could not have seen a 4 because 4 is even and the only possible numbers would have been
# 3, 5, 7 and 9 (every second number starting at 3 and ending at 9, 11 would be the next number however it is
# greater than 10)

# line 3 ... on line 3 I saw the following numbers 3.883512435108247, 4.842960180775931, 3.0855570006800654,
